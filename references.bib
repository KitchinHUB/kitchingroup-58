                  up to 47 GPa using x-ray diffraction in a diamond anvil
                  cell. At close to 4 GPa, rutile-structured PbO_{2} underwent a
                  second-order transition to an orthorhombic, CaCl_{2}-type
                  phase. Above 7 GPa, this CaCl_{2}-type phase transformed to a
                  cubic phase with a Pa\overline{3} modified fluorite
                  structure. A transition to an orthorhombic phase was observed
                  at 11.4 GPa. The intensities of the diffraction lines in this
                  orthorhombic phase indicate a displacement of the lead ions
                  from the fcc positions occupied in the cubic phase. This
                  orthorhombic phase has similar cell constants (a = 10.027(2)
                  {\AA}, b = 5.246(1) {\AA}, and c = 5.116(1) {\AA} at 26 GPa)
                  to the orthorhombic I phase of ZrO_{2} and also that of
                  HfO_{2}, and could be isostructural. A further transition
                  began above 29 GPa to a cotunnite-type phase, with space group
                  Pnam, and Z = 4, and with a = 5.443(18) {\AA}, b = 6.346(17)
                  {\AA}, and c = 3.368(8) {\AA} at 47 GPa. The coordination
                  number of the lead ion is 6 in the first two phases, 6 + 2 in
                  phase III, most probably 7 in phase IV and 9 in phase V. The
                  volume decreases observed in the three first-order transitions
                  are 6.9, 1.4, and 7.5% at 7, 11.4, and 29 GPa,
                  respectively. The two higher-pressure transitions were
                  reversible, whereas the cubic phase transformed to
                  {\alpha}-PbO_{2} upon decompression, and this was retained
                  down to ambient pressure. This is the first time a
                  cotunnite-type structure has been adopted by a group IVb
                  dioxide, which has implications for the high-pressure
                  behaviour of the homologous compounds with smaller cations:
                  SiO_{2}, GeO_{2}, and SnO_{2}.}

                  (TiO2)-based catalysts and Ti-species in porous
                  materials. Fairly comprehensive literature reviews of CO2
                  photoreduction are available already. However, this article is
                  focused on CO2 photoreduction on Ti-based catalysts, and
                  incorporates fundamental aspects of CO2 photoreduction,
                  knowledge from surface science studies of TiO2 and the surface
                  chemistry of CO2. Firstly, the current state of development of
                  this field is briefly reviewed, followed by a description of
                  and insights from surface state and surface site
                  approaches. Using examples such as metal-doping of TiO2,
                  dye-sensitization, oxygen vacancies in TiO2 and isolated-Ti
                  centers in microporous/mesoporous materials, the utility of
                  these approaches to understand photoinduced reactions involved
                  in CO2 activation is examined. Finally, challenges and
                  prospects for further development of this field are
                  presented. Enhanced understanding of the CO2:TiO2 system, with
                  a combination of computational and experimental studies is
                  required to develop catalysts exhibiting higher activity
                  towards CO2 photoreduction.}

  abstract =	 {A new study on the pressure-induced phase transitions of
                  TiO_{2} has been performed using all-electron
                  density-functional theory based computations with the
                  projector augmented wave and the linearized augmented plane
                  wave methods considering five experimentally observed
                  structures. The static results yield a picture that is
                  consistent with experiments, i.e., phase transitions with
                  pressure are predicted as rutile {\to} monoclinic baddeleyite
                  (MI) {\to} orthorhombic I (OI) {\to} cotunnite (OII) on
                  compression, and OII {\to} OI {\to} MI {\to} columbite
                  (TiO_{2}II) on decompression. The elasticities of these five
                  polymorphs are compared. Except for the baddeleyite structure,
                  which is considerably softer than the other polymorphs, all
                  phases show a zero pressure bulk modulus in the range of
                  200-240 GPa, consistent with compression results and the
                  single crystal elastic constant; on the basis of these results
                  we can say that the cotunnite phase is not a superhard TiO_{2}
                  polymorph as has been suggested previously. We further find
                  that the rutile and columbite structures are energetically
                  very similar, with the columbite structure favored
                  slightly. All polymorphs are predicted as insulating with
                  comparable band gaps ({\~}1.7-2.3 eV). Crystal field splitting
                  for the Ti 3$d$ electronic states leads to two distinct
                  conduction bands in rutile and TiO_{2}II for energies smaller
                  than 8 eV, while there is a single conduction band for the
                  other high pressure structures.}
